# Identify-Dogs-with-Pretrained-Classifier
## Image Classification for a City Dog Show
### Project Description
This project focuses on using Python programming skills to utilize an image classifier for identifying dog breeds. The task involves determining the effectiveness of various image classification algorithms in distinguishing between dogs and non-dogs, as well as accurately identifying the breed of a dog.

### Project Goal
The goal of this project is to improve Python programming skills by applying them to utilize a pre-existing image classifier. Participants are tasked with evaluating different image classification algorithms, assessing their accuracy, runtime, and performance in identifying dog breeds.

### Description
The city is hosting a dog show, and the organizing committee requires assistance in verifying the eligibility of contestants' dogs. Participants are required to submit images of their dogs along with biographical information, which is then processed by an image classifier to determine whether the submitted images depict dogs or other animals.

### Tasks
* Evaluate different image classification algorithms for distinguishing between dogs and non-dogs.
* Assess the accuracy of the chosen algorithm in identifying dog breeds.
* Measure the runtime of each algorithm to understand computational resource requirements.

### Key Notes
* Utilization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.
* Exploration of different CNN architectures (AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet) to determine the most suitable for the task.
* The provided classifier.py contains functions for utilizing the CNNs, while test_classifier.py demonstrates their usage.

### Important Considerations
* Similar-looking dog breeds may pose challenges for accurate classification.
* Training data quality influences algorithm performance, especially in distinguishing similar breeds.
